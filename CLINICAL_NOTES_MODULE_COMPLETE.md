## 🔍 Behind the Scenes

### State Management:
```typescript
// ClinicalNotesPage
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
const [statusFilter, setStatusFilter] = useState<string>('all');
const [noteTypeFilter, setNoteTypeFilter] = useState<string>('all');
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
const [selectedNote, setSelectedNote] = useState<ClinicalNote | null>(null);
const [showViewModal, setShowViewModal] = useState(false);

// Queries
const { data: notes, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['clinical-notes', statusFilter, noteTypeFilter],
  queryFn: () => clinicalNotesApi.getClinicalNotes({ status, noteType }),
});

// Mutations
const deleteMutation = useMutation({ mutationFn: clinicalNotesApi.deleteClinicalNote });
const finalizeMutation = useMutation({ mutationFn: clinicalNotesApi.finalizeClinicalNote });
```

### Filtering Logic:
```typescript
const filteredNotes = notes.filter((note) => {
  const searchLower = searchTerm.toLowerCase();
  return (
    note.chiefComplaint.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
    note.patient?.demographics?.firstName?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
    note.patient?.demographics?.lastName?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
    note.provider?.firstName?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
    note.provider?.lastName?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)
  );
});
```

### Status Badge Colors:
```typescript
- Draft → Gray (bg-gray-100 text-gray-800)
- Finalized → Blue (bg-blue-100 text-blue-800)
- Signed → Green (bg-green-100 text-green-800)
- Amended → Yellow (bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800)
- Archived → Red (bg-red-100 text-red-800)
```
