## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### **Database Schema Issue:**
The database was missing the `clinic_id` column in the `clinical_notes` table, causing this error:
```
QueryFailedError: Unknown column 'note.clinic_id' in 'field list'
```

### **Solution:**
✅ Fixed by running `database/fix-missing-columns.sql` which:
- Added `clinic_id` column to `clinical_notes` table
- Added `payment_number` and `payment_status` columns to `payments` table
- Added `balance_amount` column to `invoices` table
- Updated existing records with default values
