const bookAppointmentMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: apiService.bookAppointment,
  onSuccess: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries(['appointments']);
    showSuccessToast('Appointment booked successfully!');
  },
});

// Calendar integration with availability checking
const { data: availableSlots } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['available-slots', providerId, date],

  enabled: !!providerId && !!date,
});
```

### **2. Secure Authentication Flow**
```typescript
// Automatic token refresh with secure storage
const { login, logout, isAuthenticated } = useAuthStore();

// API interceptors for automatic token management
apiService.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  async (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      await refreshToken();
      return apiService(originalRequest);
    }
  }
);
```

### **3. Push Notifications**
```typescript
// Firebase messaging with permission handling
const requestUserPermission = async () => {
  const authStatus = await messaging().requestPermission();
  const enabled = authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.AUTHORIZED;
  
  if (enabled) {
    const token = await messaging().getToken();
    await apiService.updateDeviceToken(token);
  }
};
```

### **4. Offline Data Management**
```typescript
// Efficient caching with React Query
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
