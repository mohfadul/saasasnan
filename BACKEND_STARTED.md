# ✅ Backend Server Starting...

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** Backend is now starting with updated database schema

---

## 🚀 Backend Started!

The backend server is now starting with the **fixed database schema** that includes all 17 missing columns for Clinical Notes.

**Command:** `npm run start:dev`  
**Directory:** `C:\Users\pc\OneDrive\Desktop\SAAS\backend`

---

## ⏳ Wait ~30 Seconds

The NestJS backend needs time to:
1. Compile TypeScript
2. Connect to MySQL database
3. Initialize all modules
4. Start listening on port 3001

**Expected startup time:** 20-30 seconds

---

## ✅ When Backend is Ready

You'll see these messages in the terminal:
```
[Nest] INFO Starting Nest application...
[Nest] LOG Nest application successfully started
🚀 Healthcare Platform API running on port 3001
📚 API Documentation available at http://localhost:3001/api/docs
```
