## 🔄 How to Restart Backend

The backend needs to be restarted to recognize the new database schema.

### **Method 1: Manual Restart (Recommended)**

1. **Find the backend terminal window** (it should be running `npm run start:dev`)

2. **Stop the server:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

3. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run start:dev
   ```

4. **Wait for this message:**
   ```

   [Nest] Nest application successfully started
   ```

5. **Test the Clinical Notes page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/clinical-notes
   ```

### **Method 2: Kill and Restart (If terminal not accessible)**

1. **Open a new terminal**

2. **Navigate to your project:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\pc\OneDrive\Desktop\SAAS
   ```

3. **Find and kill the backend process:**
   ```bash
   # Find the process
   netstat -ano | findstr ":3001"
   
   # Kill it (replace XXXX with the PID number)
   taskkill /PID XXXX /F
   ```

4. **Start backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run start:dev
   ```

5. **Wait for startup message**
