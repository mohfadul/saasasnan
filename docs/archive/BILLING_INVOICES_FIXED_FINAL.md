# ✅ Billing Invoices - FINAL FIX COMPLETE!

## 🎉 **THE PROBLEM WAS FOUND AND FIXED!**

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

**Error Message:**
```
Unknown column 'invoice.clinic_id' in 'field list'
Database Error (400)
```

**The Issue:**
- The `invoices` table was missing the `clinic_id` column
- The `payments` table was also missing the `clinic_id` column
- Backend code expected these columns but they didn't exist
- Result: 400 Bad Request error

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Added `clinic_id` to `invoices` table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE invoices 
ADD COLUMN clinic_id CHAR(36) NULL AFTER tenant_id;

-- Added foreign key and index
```

### **2. Added `clinic_id` to `payments` table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE payments 
ADD COLUMN clinic_id CHAR(36) NULL AFTER tenant_id;

-- Added foreign key and index
```
