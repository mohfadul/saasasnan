## 📝 Changes Made

### File: `admin-panel/src/components/billing/InvoiceTable.tsx`

**Enhanced Mutations (Lines 28-59):**
```typescript
const sendInvoiceMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: billingApi.invoices.send,
  onSuccess: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['invoices'] });
    alert('Invoice sent successfully!'); // ← Added success message
  },
  onError: (error: any) => {
    alert(`Error sending invoice: ${error.response?.data?.message || error.message}`);
  }, // ← Added error handling
});

// Similar for markPaidMutation and deleteInvoiceMutation
```

**Enhanced Buttons (Lines 228-266):**
```typescript
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => handleSendInvoice(invoice.id)}
  disabled={sendInvoiceMutation.isPending} // ← Added disable during loading
  className="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-900 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
>
  {sendInvoiceMutation.isPending ? 'Sending...' : 'Send'} // ← Added loading state
</button>
```

### File: `admin-panel/src/components/billing/PaymentTable.tsx`

**Enhanced Mutations (Lines 28-51):**
```typescript
const refundPaymentMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: ({ id, amount, reason }: { id: string; amount: number; reason: string }) =>
    billingApi.payments.refund(id, amount, reason),
  onSuccess: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['payments'] });
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['invoices'] }); // ← Also refresh invoices
    alert('Payment refunded successfully!'); // ← Added success message
  },
  onError: (error: any) => {
    alert(`Error refunding payment: ${error.response?.data?.message || error.message}`);
  }, // ← Added error handling
});
```

**Enhanced Buttons (Lines 232-258):**
```typescript
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => handleRefundPayment(payment.id, payment.amount)}
  disabled={refundPaymentMutation.isPending} // ← Added disable during loading
  className="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-900 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
>
  {refundPaymentMutation.isPending ? 'Refunding...' : 'Refund'} // ← Added loading state
</button>
```

## 🔍 What's Happening Behind the Scenes

### Invoice "Send" Flow:
1. User clicks "Send" button (status = "draft")
2. Confirmation dialog shown
3. If confirmed:
   - `sendInvoiceMutation.mutate(invoiceId)` is called
   - Makes API request: `POST http://localhost:3001/billing/invoices/:id/send`
   - Backend updates invoice status to "sent" in database
   - Backend may also send email notification
   - Returns updated invoice
4. On success:
   - `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['invoices'])` triggers
   - React Query refetches all invoices
   - Table updates with new status
   - Success alert shown
5. Button shows loading state during API call

### Payment "Refund" Flow:
1. User clicks "Refund" button (status = "completed")
2. Prompt for refund amount (validated against max amount)
3. Prompt for refund reason
4. If both provided:
   - `refundPaymentMutation.mutate({ id, amount, reason })` is called
   - Makes API request: `POST http://localhost:3001/billing/payments/:id/refund`
   - Request body: `{ "amount": 50.00, "reason": "Customer request" }`
   - Backend:
     - Updates payment status to "refunded"
     - Creates refund transaction record
     - Updates invoice balance
     - May process gateway refund
   - Returns updated payment
5. On success:
   - Both Payments and Invoices tables refresh automatically
   - Success alert shown
   - Status badge updates to purple "refunded"

### Success Feedback:
- ✅ Success alerts shown after each action

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Priority:
Continue with **Task #5: Fix Patient Buttons** (View, Edit)

**Files to update:**
1. `admin-panel/src/components/patients/PatientTable.tsx`
   - View button → Open modal or navigate to detail page
   - Edit button → Open edit form or navigate to edit page

### Then continue with:
1. **Insurance Provider Buttons** (View, Edit, Delete)
2. **Marketplace Buttons** (View, Edit products, Adjust inventory)
3. **Build Inventory Module** (Complete from scratch)
4. **Build Clinical Notes Module** (Complete from scratch)

---

## 🎉 SUCCESS SUMMARY

**7 out of 36 buttons (19%) are now fully functional!**

### What We've Accomplished:
✅ Appointments: Confirm, Cancel (2 buttons)  
✅ Invoices: Send, Mark Paid, Delete (3 buttons)  
✅ Payments: Refund, Delete (2 buttons)

### Pattern Established:
We've proven the pattern works across multiple modules:
1. Add `onError` handlers to mutations
2. Add success alerts to `onSuccess`
3. Add `disabled={mutation.isPending}` to buttons
4. Add loading text like "Processing..."
5. Add `type="button"` attribute
6. Add disabled styles

**This pattern will be applied to all remaining 29 buttons!**
